# MRV Methodology — ACM0002 Alignment

## Applicable Methodology

**ACM0002** — Consolidated baseline and monitoring methodology for grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources (UNFCCC CDM / Verra VCS)

- Applies to: run-of-river hydropower plants
- Power density limit: ≤ 4 W/m² (prevents methane emission accounting errors)
- Scope: grid-connected generation, baseline emission displacement

## Physics Validation Formula

All submitted readings are validated against the fundamental hydropower equation:

```text
P = ρ · g · Q · H · η
```

Where:
- P = power output (watts)
- ρ = water density (997 kg/m³ at ~25°C)  
- g = gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s²)
- Q = volumetric flow rate (m³/s)
- H = effective head (m)
- η = turbine + generator efficiency (0 < η ≤ 1.0)

Any reported `generatedKwh` that deviates significantly from this formula results in a **physics trust penalty** and potential REJECTION.

## Baseline Emissions Calculation

Per ACM0002:

```text
BE_y = EG_y × EF_grid
```

Where:
- BE_y = baseline emissions (tCO₂e)
- EG_y = net electricity generated (MWh)
- EF_grid = grid emission factor (tCO₂e/MWh) — set via `EF_GRID` env var

## REC Issuance

```text
RECs_issued = floor(EG_approved / 1000) ← 1 REC per MWh
```

Only APPROVED readings contribute to REC issuance. FLAGGED and REJECTED readings are excluded.

## Trust Score Weights

| Check | Weight | Basis |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Physics validation | 40% | ACM0002 generation formula |
| Temporal consistency | 25% | Monitoring continuity requirements |
| Environmental bounds | 20% | Water quality / operational parameters |
| Statistical anomaly | 15% | Statistical anomaly detection |

## Monitoring Report

Generated by `generateMonitoringReport()`:
- Total readings submitted
- Approved / Flagged / Rejected counts
- Average trust score across period
- Total verified generation (MWh)
- Total baseline emissions displaced (tCO₂e)
- Total RECs issued

## Hedera Guardian Alignment Path

This system is designed to integrate with [Hedera Guardian](https://guardian.hedera.com) for full Verra VCS policy enforcement:

1. **Current:** Custom MRV engine with ACM0002 calculations
2. **Next:** Export attestations as Guardian-compatible policy artifacts
3. **Production:** Guardian policy with Verra VCS Standard schema → VCU issuance
